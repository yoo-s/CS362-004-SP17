Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
Current player’s deck count after playing the adventurer card does not equal the original deck count minus the cards drawn into the player’s hand.

Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Run randomtestadventurer, and see that the current player’s deck count’s value is not the expected value (deck count before playing card minus cards drawn) for each test that is run.

Expected Results
----------------
Player’s deck count should equal the original game state’s deck count minus the number of cards drawn into the current player’s hand. testG.deckCount[p1] should equal G.deckCount[p] - newCards + shuffledCards.

Actual Results
--------------
Player’s deck count does not equal the original game state’s deck count minus the number of cards drawn into the current player’s hand.

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
The gainCard() function draws cards from empty supply piles when it shouldn’t.

Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Run unittest4, and see that calling gainCard() on a card after setting the game state’s supplyCount of that card to 0 results in a return value of 0 instead of -1, meaning it succeeded instead of failed.

Expected Results
----------------
Test that card cannot be gained from empty supply pile:
gain = -1, expected = -1

Actual Results
--------------
Test that card cannot be gained from empty supply pile:
gain = 0, expected = -1

Workarounds
